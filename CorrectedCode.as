The corrected code uses a null check to avoid the error.  This is best practice when dealing with potentially null objects in ActionScript 3.

```actionscript
// Check if myObject is null before accessing its property
if (myObject != null) {
  trace(myObject.someProperty);
} else {
  trace("myObject is null"); // Handle the null case
}
```

Alternatively, the optional chaining operator (`?.`) available in newer versions of ActionScript can simplify this:

```actionscript
trace(myObject?.someProperty);
```

This will safely return `undefined` if `myObject` is null, preventing the error.  However, ensure that your ActionScript environment supports this feature.
